# JanSetu: AI-Powered Smart City Complaint Analysis & Automation System

JanSetu is a next-generation civic governance platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and government authorities using Artificial Intelligence, Real-time Mapping, and Multi-channel Communication (WhatsApp + Web).


## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Channel Reporting
*   **WhatsApp Chatbot**: Direct reporting via WhatsApp. Supports stateful conversations, intent detection, and native **GPS Location Pin** sharing.
*   **Web Portal**: A high-fidelity React dashboard for citizens to report issues with images and geolocation.

### 2. JanSetu AI Brain (Powered by Groq)
*   **Automatic Categorization**: AI identifies if a report belongs to Water Supply, Electricity, Public Works, etc.
*   **Severity Analysis**: Determines the urgency of every case based on semantic context (e.g., "Live wire" = High Priority).
*   **Semantic Clustering**: Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to group similar reports, identifying city-wide **Hotspots** automatically.

### 3. Executive Command Center
*   **Overwatch Map**: Real-time visual heatmaps of civic issues using `react-leaflet`.
*   **Departmental Dashboards**: Authority-specific feeds that prioritize the most urgent cases first.
*   **Analytics Engine**: Instant reporting of load distribution across city departments.

### 4. Smart Notifications & Escalation
*   **Direct Alerts**: Automated emails to department heads when new critical issues are assigned.
*   **Escalation Protocols**: If an issue isn't resolved within its SLA deadline, it is automatically escalated and flagged in the Executive Insight view.
